# Octave_HDD
Friction resistance calcul for a read head in a HDD varying with the rotation speed, the fluid and the temperature of the disc.

Please, be aware of the fact that Octave doesn't give each time the graph for a unknown reason but you only have to close the graph window and restart it.

Moreover, the graph can be modified according to the temperature that you want to test. You can see his influence on the density of the fluid and the friction resistance wich can also varying with the  speed of the disc. The speed's given are the standards one from now and before.
